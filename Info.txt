Rāhu (Sanskrit: राहु, ☊) is one of the nine major celestial bodies (navagraha) in Hindu texts and the king of meteors.[1] It represents the ascension of the Moon in its precessional orbit around the Earth, also referred as the north lunar node,[2] and along with Ketu, is a "shadow planet" that causes eclipses. Despite having no physical existence, Rahu has been allocated the status of the planet by ancient seers owing to its strong influence in astrology.

Rahu is usually paired with Ketu, another shadow planet. The time of day considered to be under the influence of Rahu is called Rāhu kāla and is considered inauspicious.
