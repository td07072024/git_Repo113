The Rig Veda mentions that during a solar eclipse, the sons of Atri were conflicted and succeeded to free Surya.[11]

Jalandhara
Main article: Jalandhara
Following his ascent to power, the asura Jalandhara was advised by the great sage Narada to seek out a consort. Narada hinted that the beautiful Parvati, consort of Shiva, would be an excellent choice.[12] Infatuated with her beauty and impaired in his judgment, Jalandhara summoned his emissary Rahu, and sent him to the mountain Kailasa, to demand that Shiva give up his wife to Jalandhara. Rahu delivered the message informing Shiva that being a humble yogi who lived in the cremation grounds and the jungle as a naked ascetic, he was unworthy of the fairest goddess.[13][12] He added that since Jalandhara was the powerful new lord of the heavens, the underworld, and the Earth, he was more worthy of her.[12][14] Upon hearing these insults, Shiva produced a thunderous sound and a great lion-like monster from his brow named Kirtimukha. The monster chased and seized Rahu with the intention of devouring him. Rahu pleaded with Shiva for his life and retracted his claims, instead praising Shiva and seeking protection and refuge with him. In response, Shiva called off Kirtimukhaâ€™s attack and set Rahu free to relay these events back to Jalandhara.
